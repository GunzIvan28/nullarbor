# Nullabor
Pipeline to generate complete public health microbiology reports from Illumnina sequenced isolates

## Etymology

The [Nullarbor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullarbor_Plain) is a huge treeless plain that spans the area between south-west and south-east Australia. It comes from the Latin "nullus" (no) and "arbor" (tree), or "no trees". As this software will generate a tree, there is an element of Australian irony in the name.
